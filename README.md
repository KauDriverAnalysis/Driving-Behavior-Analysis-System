## Project Overview

The Driving Behavior Analysis System is comprised of two major parts:

### 1. **Hardware Components**
- **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) + GPS**: Collects real-time data on vehicle movement and location. The IMU provides acceleration and angular velocity data, while the GPS ensures precise location tracking.
- **ESP Microcontroller**: Utilizes **FreeRTOS** for efficient multitasking and real-time data processing.
- **GSM Module**: Transmits sensor data to the cloud via secure communication protocols.

### 2. **Software Components**
- **MQTT Protocol**: Ensures lightweight and efficient data transfer between the hardware and backend systems.
- **Django Backend Framework**: Processes and organizes incoming data, prepares it for analysis, and renders the results.
- **React Frontend**: A user-friendly interface for visualizing analyzed data, deployed seamlessly on **Netlify** for easy access.

## Data Flow Overview

The system follows a streamlined data processing pipeline, ensuring high performance and accuracy:

1. **Sensors (IMU + GPS)**: Collect raw motion and location data from the vehicle.
2. **ESP Microcontroller**: Processes the data locally and sends it via GSM.
3. **GSM Module**: Transmits data to the cloud using the MQTT protocol.
4. **Django Backend**: Receives, processes, and organizes the data for analysis.
5. **React Frontend**: Visualizes the analyzed data in an interactive and flexible manner, offering insights into driving behavior.
6. **Netlify Deployment**: Ensures the frontend is accessible on any device, providing a seamless user experience.
